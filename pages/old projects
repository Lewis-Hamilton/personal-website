            <P>My ignite instructor asked for my help in making an ardiuno tool that students could use to learn code. I
                plugged
                in wires to ardiunos that were already mounted on a piece of wood. Then I soldered them to screws that were
                also
                already installed in the wood. It was a simple project but it took a long time to finish all six of them.
